# The KGC Book Club Ontology

A project to construct a book club ontology, and instanciate it with data from KGC book clubs.

We will be using this repository to kick off the project. The following folders are created for now. Feel free to suggest another folder if you have a specific need.

* Data: to store all the data files (instances)
* Models: to store data models
* Tutorials: to store any kind of examples or experiments of what to do with this project.
