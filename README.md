# The KGC Book Club Ontology

A project to construct a book club ontology, and instanciate it with data from KGC book clubs.

We will be using this repository to kick off the project. The following folders are created for now. Feel free to suggest another folder if you have a specific need.

* Data: to store all the data files (instances)
* Models: to store data models
* Tutorials: to store any kind of examples or experiments of what to do with this project.

The goal of the KGC Book Club Ontology Working Group is to support ongoing learning and community efforts around the KGC Book Club program.

The plan is to bring together KGC Book Club members with diverse perspectives and experience to create ontologies related to Book Club topics, and to produce prototypes of interest and value to the wider KGC community.

The broader goal of the project is to produce artifacts that are accessible to a wider audience looking to understand Semantic Web standards and their relation to Knowledge Graph technologies.

Our first use case / competency question to consider is "Where in the book is concept X discussed?"
